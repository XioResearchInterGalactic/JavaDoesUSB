/**
 * Output stream for bulk endpoints â€“ optimized for high throughput.
 *
 * <p>
 * Multiple asynchronous transfers are submitted to achieve a good
 * degree of concurrency between the USB communication handled by the operating
 * system and the producing application code. The number of concurrent transfers is limited
 * in order to retain flow control and keep memory usage at a reasonable size.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For thread synchronization (between the background thread handling IO completion
 * and the producing application thread) a blocking queue is used. It is prefilled with
 * transfer instances ready to be used. The background thread adds the completed
 * instances back to this queue. The producing application thread waits until a transfer instance
 * is available for use.
